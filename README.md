## [Incident management & on-call](https://betterstack.com/incident-management)

Create, acknowledge, and resolve incidents directly from Slack while Better Stack keeps timelines, escalations, and status-page updates in sync. Let engineers focus on fixing the issue instead of answering “what’s the latest?” and keep your on-call rotations and SLAs under control.

## [Uptime monitoring](https://betterstack.com/uptime)

The most reliable uptime monitoring with a generous free tier.

Monitor websites, APIs, ping, SSL, domains, email and more from multiple locations with fast checks and automatic false-positive reduction using traceroute and MTR. Start with 10 monitors, 10 heartbeats, and a status page for free so you can actually monitor what matters from day one.

## [Status page](https://betterstack.com/status-page)

Beautiful public or private status pages on your own domain, set up in seconds.

Keep customers and internal teams informed with real-time incident updates, historical uptime charts, dark mode, and full branding. Uptime checks and incident management plug straight into your page, so you’re not manually editing a spreadsheet during an outage.

## [Tracing](https://betterstack.com/tracing)

Instrument your cluster without making any code changes. Ingest everything at a fraction of the cost.

Auto-instrument your Kubernetes or Docker clusters at the kernel level, build a live service map, and correlate traces with logs and metrics without touching application code. Ingest everything at a fraction of the usual APM price so you can stop sampling away the data you actually need to debug production.

## [Log management](https://betterstack.com/log-management)

OpenTelemetry-native log management that feels like a data warehouse for your logs.

Ship structured logs via the Better Stack collector, which also captures metrics and traces using eBPF. Store wide JSON events in cheap object storage, promote critical signals to fast time-series on NVMe, and query everything with SQL over HTTP – with incident management, tracing, and infra monitoring built in.

## [Infrastructure monitoring](https://betterstack.com/infrastructure-monitoring)

OpenTelemetry-native, Prometheus-compatible infra monitoring without running Prometheus yourself.

Collect metrics from Kubernetes, VMs, and services using OpenTelemetry while keeping your existing Prometheus exporters and query patterns. Better Stack handles storage, retention, and dashboards so you get long-term metrics, alerting, and correlation with logs and traces minus the self-hosted Prometheus pain.

## [Error tracking](https://betterstack.com/error-tracking)

Sentry-compatible error tracking at 1/6th the price.

Drop in Sentry SDKs, send exceptions straight into Better Stack Errors, and get full context with stack traces, tags, breadcrumbs. Solve issues in minutes using your AI assistant and a pre-built prompt. Migrate without rewrites, cut your bill, and keep errors, logs, and traces under one roof.

## [Data warehouse](https://betterstack.com/warehouse)

Time-series data warehouse as an API.

Ingest petabytes of time-based JSON events, transform them into time series, and run arbitrary analytical SQL via HTTP or from your own apps. Keep raw data in S3, power real-time dashboards and client-facing APIs, and control retention and spend with TTLs and spending alerts.
